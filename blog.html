        <h6>Creating a Personal Website in Bootstrap4</h6>
        <p>I thought that since I had the basics in CSS, just to complete a personal website assignment, it should've been somewhat easy to use Bootstrap 4. It is, and it isn't. I found out soon enough, that I didn't use CSS anywhere near enough to remember half the things I learned a year ago. Although trying to create something in a short amount of time, Bootstrap 4 was a blessing.</p><p>With Bootstrap 4, you have choices to go with a ready-made theme or go with the blank slate basics template, for which you could pick and choose functionality to include for your website, which was what I used. I didn't want to have to go through the confusion of stripping out a bunch of stuff I wasn't going to use.</p><p>I wanted something simple and basic. After sketching out something I envisioned, I picked out my Google fonts; then I picked out a simple nav from their gallery. Next, I wanted a plain responsive grid for my projects and blog and simple sticky footer, which gave it a kind of old school throwback to the 90's kind of look. Pretty basic, but using Bootstrap 4, I had something within a day. And from here, I have the freedom to change it any way I want according to any future needs.</p>

        <h6>Newbie Frustrations in CSS Land</h6>
        <p>I've learned a few things with dealing with CSS so far. #1: Inspect element is your friend to find out what is overriding your added CSS. Box model is your friend. #2: Dude. Go here: https://specificity.keegan.st. #3: It pays to save and reload after each change made. Or if you're lazy, use browser sync to save yourself the trouble. #4: Take a breaks regularly, drink some water, do some sit-ups or yoga, crack some jokes, listen to some music, then come back to your problem. Sometimes, I find the solution or an alternative right after. In the very least, it makes it bearable and I'm able to move onward.</p>
