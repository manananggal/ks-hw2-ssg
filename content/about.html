      <p>I love any excuse to be creative. In my whimsical free time, I oftentimes fantasize about living in my dream home; planning the next ultra-dream travel destination; or planning the next tea party, constantly coming up with any excuse to use my vintage tea paraphernalia.</p>

      <p>In a previous life, I was a perennial assistant across different industries; was oftentimes picked to be in the jury box; and usually found myself "volunteered" to be on the company safety team.</p>

      <p>Currently, aside from constantly learning and trying to keep up with the latest and greatest of tools to build beautiful, responsive websites alongside my partner, I lead a double-life as a Facebook secretary, nutritionist, dream analyzer, masseuse, card game opponent and muse, usually occurring during breaks in between working on websites. I aspire to play in a band, play the ukelele, and be a really, super-badass code ninja. I'm an incessant list-taker, over-thinker, planner, and have been accused of Googling all the time.</p>
