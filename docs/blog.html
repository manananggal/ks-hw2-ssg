        <h6>Creating a Personal Website in Bootstrap4</h6>
        <p>Since I had the basics in CSS, or so I thought, I figured it should've been somewhat easy to use Bootstrap 4. Well, it was, and it wasn't. I found out soon enough I didn't remember anywhere near enough CSS to remember even half the things I learned a year ago. Although, whether or not trying to create a site in a short amount of time, Bootstrap 4 is a blessing of efficiency. These guys have so many things figured out already.</p><p>One could choose to go with a ready-made theme or with a blank-slate-type basic template, for which one could just pick/choose ready-made functionality from a gallery according to your purposes, which was what I chose to do. I didn't want to have to strip out a bunch of stuff I wasn't even going to use. (Even with the stripped down version, I still had to strip some stuff out.)</p><p>I just wanted something simple and basic. Soon after quickly sketching out what I envisioned, I picked out some fonts, a simple nav from the Bootstrap gallery, and chose a simple-looking, responsive grid for both my projects and blog pages. Once I knew exactly what I wanted, though simple, I had something within a day, after I picked, resized and saved my pics for the web with PhotoShop. And from here, I have the freedom to change the look and feel any way I want according to any future whims or needs.</p>

        <h6>Newbie Frustrations in CSS Land</h6>
        <p>I've learned a few things with dealing with CSS so far: #1: What the heck is overriding your added CSS?? Inspect element, and box model in inspect element is your friend. #2: Why the heck is it overriding your added CSS? Easy. Go here: <a href="https://specificity.keegan.st" target="_blank">https://specificity.keegan.st</a>. #3: It pays to save changes and reload your webpage after each change. Or if you're lazy, I suppose you could choose to use browser sync to save yourself the trouble. #4: Take a breaks regularly: drink some water or eat something, do some sit-ups or push-ups, get your Zen on: do some yoga or meditation, crack some jokes, walk around the block, listen to some music, -- point is: to take a quick break, reset, reframe, then come back to your problem refreshed. Many times, you find the solution or an alternative route right after. In the very least, CSS or otherwise, it makes things more bearable and you'll be able to move onward and upward to bigger, better, more.</p>
